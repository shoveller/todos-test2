# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Project Name:** todos-test2  
**Project Type:** Full-Stack Web Application  
**Development Status:** Initial Template Phase  
**Primary Technology:** React Router v7 with TypeScript

## Project Scope

### What This Project Does
This project serves as a modern React Router v7 template application, providing a production-ready foundation for building full-stack React applications with server-side rendering capabilities.

### Core Purpose
- **Template Foundation:** Provides a clean, modern starting point for React Router applications
- **Best Practices Showcase:** Demonstrates current web development standards and patterns
- **Educational Resource:** Serves as a learning tool for React Router v7 features and SSR implementation
- **Development Accelerator:** Reduces setup time and configuration overhead for new projects

### Why This Project Exists
1. **Modern Web Standards:** React Router v7 introduces significant improvements over previous versions
2. **Developer Productivity:** Eliminates repetitive setup and configuration tasks
3. **Production Readiness:** Includes Docker, TypeScript, and optimization out of the box
4. **Learning Bridge:** Helps developers transition from older React patterns to modern practices

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Zero-Configuration Start:** Developers can begin building features immediately
2. **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript integration throughout the stack
3. **Performance Excellence:** Optimized for both development speed and production performance
4. **Deployment Flexibility:** Support multiple deployment scenarios and platforms

### Success Criteria
- **Setup Time:** < 5 minutes from clone to running application
- **Developer Experience:** Instant feedback with HMR and type checking
- **Production Performance:** Sub-2-second initial page load
- **Code Quality:** 100% TypeScript coverage with strict type checking

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Application Framework:** React Router v7 implementation
- **Development Tools:** Modern build pipeline with Vite and TypeScript
- **Styling System:** TailwindCSS utility-first styling
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization and production optimization
- **Developer Experience:** Hot reloading, type generation, and error handling

### Out of Scope (Currently)
- **Specific Business Logic:** Template remains generic and customizable
- **Database Integration:** Data persistence to be added based on specific needs
- **Authentication System:** User management to be implemented per use case
- **Advanced State Management:** Complex state solutions to be added as needed

### Future Considerations
- **Feature Extensions:** Potential Todo application implementation (based on project name)
- **Database Layer:** Integration with modern database solutions
- **API Development:** Backend API expansion for full-stack functionality
- **Testing Framework:** Comprehensive test suite implementation

## Technical Scope

### Architecture Decisions
- **Full-Stack SSR:** Server-side rendering for optimal performance and SEO
- **File-Based Routing:** Intuitive route organization following filesystem structure
- **Modern React:** React 19 with latest patterns and concurrent features
- **Type-First Development:** TypeScript throughout with generated route types

### Technology Constraints
- **Node.js Runtime:** Server-side execution environment
- **pnpm Package Manager:** Efficient dependency management
- **Vite Build System:** Fast development and optimized production builds
- **Container Deployment:** Docker-first deployment strategy

## Project Timeline & Phases

### Phase 1: Template Foundation (Current)
- ✅ React Router v7 template implementation
- ✅ TypeScript configuration and type safety
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling integration
- ✅ Docker containerization setup

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Planned)
- Feature-specific implementation based on project direction
- Database integration and data modeling
- API endpoint development
- User interface enhancement

### Phase 3: Production Optimization (Future)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security hardening and audit
- Testing framework and coverage
- CI/CD pipeline implementation

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Node.js:** Version 20 or higher
- **pnpm:** Version 10+ for package management
- **Docker:** For containerization and deployment
- **TypeScript:** Version 5+ for type safety

### Deployment Infrastructure
- **Container Platform:** Docker-compatible hosting
- **Static Assets:** CDN for client-side resources
- **Server Resources:** Node.js runtime environment
- **Database:** To be determined based on feature requirements

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Framework Maturity:** React Router v7 is relatively new
- **Dependency Updates:** Rapid evolution of web development tools
- **Performance Scaling:** Server-side rendering resource requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Template Flexibility:** Architecture allows for easy framework updates
- **Lock File Management:** Consistent dependency versions across environments
- **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in optimization and monitoring capabilities

## Success Measurements

### Development Metrics
- **Time to First Feature:** How quickly developers can add new functionality
- **Build Performance:** Development and production build times
- **Error Rate:** TypeScript compile-time error prevention

### Application Metrics
- **Page Load Performance:** Core Web Vitals compliance
- **Bundle Optimization:** JavaScript and CSS asset sizes
- **Deployment Success:** Container deployment reliability
